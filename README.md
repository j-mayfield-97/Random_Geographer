# Random_Mapper
A randomizer for making fantasy maps images
## Dependencies
- Lua 5.1 or later
- Lua-GD 	2.9.33r2 or later
- IUP (for Lua) 3.5.0	 or later
- Windows CMD
Suggested download : [Lua for windows](https://github.com/rjpcomputing/luaforwindows)
## Steps
- Install all the dependencies
### Make Customized Single Map
- Run the map_plotter.lua script however you run Lua files
- Use the dialog box to customize map constants, then press "okay"
- A png file should open with your newly generated map
### Make Many Maps
- Run the many_maps.lua script
- Enter the number of maps you wish to generate
- Enter the coefficient for how much grouping you want
- A file should be created with many newly generated maps
## Purpose
I was inspired to create this after seeing a video of a person filling a bucket of dice and pouring it onto a sheet. Each dice represented a different type of structure wherever they landed on the sheet. The person would then outline around the stucture to make the natural geography of a map. I wanted to do that process on my own but I don't have so many dice, few people do. I thought I could make something to simulate that process but many times over, and with more space and dice than possible in real life. I also wanted more experience with Lua.
## Notes
- Black is the dedicated land color, the large bodies of water are whatever color you set the background to
- The larger the coefficient the more gruoping will occur, theres a tooltip
- Just have fun

I recommend not interpretting the maps literally. It's meant to be fun fantasy. If there's multiple overlapping icons I just imagine it's a combination of the overlapping. Sor example a mountain and a lake, make a natural hotspring high above the clouds. Or the lakes could be what ever oyu want them to be, maybe icebergs or deserts instead.

It's just kind of relaxing to imagine an adventure through the lands you're sculpting. There are options for rounded maps and straight line maps which are both pretty fun. I also enjoy the no lines and put the map into the simplest paint program and draw the geography by hand. These maps also act as a kind of Rorschach test if you'd like.

Also, if you want something else added to this app, I'll see what I can do.
